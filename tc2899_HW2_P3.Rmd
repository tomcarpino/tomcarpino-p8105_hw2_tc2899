_Problem 3: Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART), 2002-2010_

*Read and Clean BRFSS data*
```{r}

# importing brfss_smart2010 data

devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets") 

# add library that includes dataset 
library("p8105.datasets")
library(magrittr)

brfss_smart2010
```

```{r problem3}
# below: clean names, filter by "Overall Health", remove unwanted vars
# long -> wide with key=reponse and value= data_value
# new variable: proportion (excellent + very good / total)

brfss_data = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, 
         -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_positive = (excellent + very_good) /
      (excellent + very_good + good + fair + poor))

#*Questions*

*How many unique locations are included in the dataset?*
*Is every state represented?* 
*What state is observed the most?*

```{r}
```

*In 2002, what is the median of the “Excellent” response value?*

```{r}
```

*Make a histogram of “Excellent” response values in the year 2002.*

```{r}
```

*Make a scatterplot showing the proportion of “Excellent” response values in New York County and Queens County (both in NY State) in each year from 2002 to 2010.*

```{r}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
