_Problem 3: Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART), 2002-2010_

*Read and Clean BRFSS data*
```{r}
```

*Format the data to use appropriate variable names*
```{r}
```

*Exclude variables of class, topic, question, sample size, and everything from lower confidence limit to GeoLocation*
```{r}
```

*Structure data so that responses (excellent to poor) are variables taking the value of Data_value*
```{r}
```

*Create new variable showing proportion of responses that were “Excellent” or “Very Good”*
```{r}
```

*How many unique locations are included in the dataset?*
*Is every state represented?* 
*What state is observed the most?*

```{r}
```

*In 2002, what is the median of the “Excellent” response value?*

```{r}
```

*Make a histogram of “Excellent” response values in the year 2002.*

```{r}
```

*Make a scatterplot showing the proportion of “Excellent” response values in New York County and Queens County (both in NY State) in each year from 2002 to 2010.*

```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
